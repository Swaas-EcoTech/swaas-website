      description:
        "SWAAS, in collaboration with the Robin Hood Army, conducted the Donation Drive 2025 from 17th to 21st February, aiming to spread warmth and support to those in need. Donation boxes were placed across the campus at Main Gate, Lab Block, Canteen, Under the Bridge, and Mother Dairy, collecting generous contributions of clothes, books, toys, and daily essentials. As part of the initiative, SWAAS volunteers personally distributed these donated items to underprivileged children, bringing smiles and comfort to their lives. The team also organized a food drive, sharing freshly prepared meals and spending quality time teaching and interacting with children in the park. The drive was a heartfelt effort to give back to society, and a shining example of how small acts of kindness can create a big impact. Together, we made a difference—one donation, one meal, one smile at a time.",
